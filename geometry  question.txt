So basically, if x1>=xc, then nearest point is x1
if x2<=xc then nearest point is x2
if in between, then nearest point is xc itself. On this assumption we can analyze for y as well.

Now if we find out distance between center of circle and this nearest point, then we can say true is this distance is <= radius. Else it is false.
